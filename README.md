# php-dev
Web tests and projects built primarily with PHP on a LEMP stack.

This repository is primarily for learning purposes, so it is very possible some files that are typically ignored will be pushed and viewable here. It is also possible for the file structure to change, either slightly or dramatically.

Some projects are viewable on <a href="https://gavinvaught.com">my website</a>.

All code is available to use educational purposes. If you have any questions, <a href="mailto:gavinvaught@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
